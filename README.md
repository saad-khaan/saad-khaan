## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🖥️ [AutoTicket Dashboard](https://github.com/saad-khaan/AutoTicket)
A full‑stack application to monitor network endpoints with automated diagnostics.  

**Features:**
- **Perl-powered diagnostics:** A Perl script pings each endpoint and logs real-time status results.
- **Python data processing:** A Python script reads Perl log output, then updates ticket statuses and writes back to database.
- **Flask backend & REST-like routes:** Handles ticket management (add/edit/delete) and integrates the diagnostic workflow.  
- **SQLite database:** Stores tickets and their diagnostic status.  
- **Modern UI:** A clean dashboard to view statuses and trigger diagnostics at any time.
